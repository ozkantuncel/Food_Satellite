### Libraries Used
---

* [Architecture][2]: XML architecture is a markup language used to define the structure and content of data. In the Android application development process, XML files are commonly used to define user interface elements and resources in a hierarchical structure.
* [Viewbinding][4]: View binding is a feature that simplifies the process of writing code that interacts with views. When view binding is enabled in a module, a binding class is generated for each XML layout file present in that module. An instance of a binding class contains direct references to all views that have an ID in the corresponding layout.
* [RecyclerView][3]: RecyclerView makes it easy to efficiently display large sets of data.
* [Glide][5]: Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
* [Room][6]: The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Retrofit][7]: for turns your HTTP API into a Java interface
* [Gson][8]: For convert Java Objects into their JSON representation and between composables data transfer.
* [RecyclerViewSwipeDecorator][9]: A simple utility class to add a background, an icon and a label to a RecyclerView item while swiping it left or right.
* [OKHTTP3][10]: HTTP is the way modern applications network. It’s how we exchange data & media. Doing HTTP efficiently makes your stuff load faster and saves bandwidth.
* [Dagger-Hilt][11]: Hilt is the recommended solution for dependency injection in Android apps.
* [Hawk][12]: Secure, simple key-value storage for android
